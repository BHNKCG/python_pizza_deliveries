# python_pizza_deliveries
# Project Overview

This project is a simple Python-based Pizza Ordering and Billing System that calculates the final price of a pizza based on the user’s choices.

The program asks the user to select the pizza size and choose optional toppings such as pepperoni and extra cheese.

Based on these inputs, the program calculates the total bill and displays it to the user.

This project demonstrates basic Python programming concepts, decision-making using conditions, and user interaction.

# What Is Happening in This Project?

The program prompts the user to enter:

The size of the pizza (S, M, or L)

Whether pepperoni is required (Y or N)

Whether extra cheese is required (Y or N)

The base price of the pizza is determined by its size.

Additional charges are added if pepperoni or extra cheese is selected.

Conditional statements are used to calculate the correct bill amount.

Finally, the total price is printed to the console.

Each time the program runs, the bill changes depending on the user’s selections.
